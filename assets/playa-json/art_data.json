Labyrinth of a Colorful Cloud by Rob Fischer Miami, FL Labyrinth of a Colorful Cloud is a huge interactive maze made of translucent hand-painted panes of glass.  The sculpture is inspired by and in honor of Micheline Charest.  While she has passed from this world, she will be present when her son Eric Charest-Weinberg marries Elizabeth Fate. Humans attempt to explain their lives by citing the series of critical choices and dramatic moments that shift and divert their path. They attempt to \u201cbecome\u201d something or someone, but it is usually the minute, unnoticed decisions that shape their existence. In retrospect, people realize that it was a series of both beautiful and painful moments that define who they are.",

This project means everything to us as so many members of the Tuna Guy family are spread around the country and are unable to gather in one spot to mourn the loss of the Captain, who Burning Man Organization describes as \u201cThe Tuna Guys are an iconic playa legend, part of the fabric of Black Rock City, and an enduring icon of Gifting at its best\u201d in the Jackrabbit Speaks.

The Sub-Sonarium by Benjamin Carpenter / Daniel Yasmin Oakland, CA The Sub-Sonarium is an exploration of the psychology that surrounds the associations between sound and emotions. It is an immersive, kinetic, interactive sound sculpture that synthesizes uncontrollable forces in a controlled environment. Standing eighteen feet tall with an equal footprint, it has two opposing doors that lead to the center where visitors are encouraged to sit, relax, listen and participate.  The Sub-Sonarium mimics the chaotic sounds of rolling thunder via acoustic, percussive mechanisms. Its chamber contains a series of long, dangling springs that are connected to large membranes embedded in the ceiling. Interacting with these springs causes movement to travel up to the membranes creating random vibrations in the surrounding air.  It was designed to bring temporary relief from hyper-reality and commercial driven anxiety through immersion in an audible, low frequency environment. These frequencies are similar to those used to bring shifts in consciousness and achieve meditative states.",

Super Street Fire by Seth Hardy Toronto, ON SUPER STREET FIRE is a simulated fighting game in the style of Street Fighter. However, instead of playing a traditional video game, the participants interact with the game with motions and thoughts. Instead of an actual fight, the participants face off by controlling a ring of 32 flame effects, creating fire of their own color to attack and defend. Each participant wears a pair of gloves that reacts to specific gestures and a headset that reads their brain activity. A punch will send a single wave of fire towards the other player\u2019s side; raising a hand in a blocking gesture will create a stationary pillar of fire that will block the oncoming wave; a consistent focused thought will send a rapid pattern of flames across the entire ring. Players can try to win by making simple attacks, or looking for moves inspired by video games they played long ago\u2026",

The Temple of Juno by David Best Petaluma, CA The temple is returning back to the traditional style of temple that our community is familiar with, that we have built over the years as a temple crew. The temple grounds will incorporate a central temple building sitting within a large walled courtyard. The courtyard is accessible by four entrances, on each of the temple sides. Benches line the exterior space, and surround the temple. The scale of the central temple building is smaller than the last years of the temples, but will be the most detailed temple we have built. The central building will have altar space, occupied floors, and a tower. Intricately cut wooden panels and shapes will cover the courtyard walls as well as the interior space and the altars. The temple\u2019s large enclosed exterior space, along with its interior structure and altar space is intended to address the needs of our community, to reflect and meditate in private.",

The most unlikely of things must conspire to create something unexpected. A deceptively small, almost unknowable thing can take root and flourish into something far more complex, unknowable and unpredictable from its inauspicious beginnings. A thought can grow into a revolution, an encounter into a relationship. It all begins with a seed. To describe this process Zoa unfolds and reveals in three parts; first, a beautiful, elegant, translucent structure inspired by seedpods rises from the playa floor; next, an awe inspiring mid-week burn; which then reveals an unexpected sculptural array which has been hidden within.",

Zonotopia and the Two Trees by Rob Bell San Francisco, CA The Zomes of Zonotopia arise from the playa like ancient jewel-like radiolaria of epic proportion. Each structure, composed of interlocking wooden rhombic panels, creates a space of meeting, greeting and playing. The energy within harnesses a nostalgia for the primordial with a deeply meditated vision of the future. These beautiful intercelestial escape capsules free the imagination from constraining thoughts and previous perceptions regarding structure. The Zomes form a courtyard embracing the Two Trees of Zonotopia. Towering above the playa the Trees of Silver and Gold represent the duality of nature.  One of Silver, like moonlight, masculine, silent and strong, illuminated like falling rain on a moon-lit night. One of Gold, like the Sun, feminine, fiery and fierce, illuminated like fire, giver of life and the source of all things. From Duality a union is formed, zome mani padme zome",
