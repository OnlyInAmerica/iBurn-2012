Also explored is the role of mysticism and metaphor in the language of alchemical principles, wherein these descriptions are an allegory for spiritual human transformation as described by C.G. Jung and others. The development of images, art forms, and physical scientific practices is noted, as is the impact of this mystical practice on fields as diverse as medicine, chemistry, and meditation. Please join us for this deep look at alchemy as an idea, an act of art making, and a rebellious act of defiance.\"",

Join guest teacher from Berlin, Germany Dagmar Cee for this 2 hour class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.5rhythms-berlin.de/",

Romances, of course!\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how it works: come by and just watch if you like. Then if you decide you\u2019d like to participate throw your name into one or more of the following hats: \u201cstraight male, straight female, gay male, or lesbian female.\u201d When it\u2019s time for a new scene we will decide whether it\u2019s straight, gay, or lesbian (based on interest) and draw two names out of the appropriate hat(s) to determine who from the audience will play the two romantic leads. Then we will view a scene from a romance movie, \u201cthe kiss\u201d, the scene in the movie where the leads \u201cconnect.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter viewing this scene, our Baggage Check film director will direct the two randomly selected volunteers from the audience in recreating this scene, acting out the roles of the romantic leads, while our film crew captures the moment. For example, we might announce that the next scene will be a straight scene and we'd draw names from the straight male and straight female hats. Then we'd announce the movie as, for example, African Queen, and the man and woman selected would play the roles of Humphrey Bogart and Kathrine Hepburn. We would watch the scene on the boat when they've just successfully run the rapids and they kiss for the first time. Then the chosen actors would act out that scene.\r\n\r\nThen while we repeat this process for more scenes we will edit the results of earlier scenes so that we can view them later in the evening, as they are edited.",

ALIA transmits the bliss she experiences in performances to create a connected, alive and activated experience that evokes the sacred and awakens our connection to our source through rhythm and movement.

Yando and Zed will tell you all about the Gate as you drive out Gate Road.  Safety is number 1 with the Gate crew and if the weather and the traffic conditions are right, you and your scout will find yourselves searching cars for stowaways and other contraband (dogs, fireworks and  MOOP Makers) in incoming vehicles.  If the conditions are not safe, don\u2019t worry because the Gate crew always has shelter and something fun up their sleeves. \r\n\r\nAbout Gate: \r\n\r\nGate processes all the arriving cars and tears your burning man ticket. We are the dusty people who search every car, truck, and RV looking for things that create MOOP and other things that are not allowed.\r\n\r\nPerimeter is the force in the desert that keeps a keen lookout for people who are lost.\r\n\r\nExodus is the team that you see when you leave burning man. We are the line between here and there. We are the hard edge. We are the last stop before and after bliss. We are the dust.\r\n\r\nWe are all three departments all rolled up into one, we are the GATE... and we can't wait to meet you kids!",

Teams may also be Traffic Rangers, directing cars in with the orange batons. \r\n\r\nBecause we are dealing with moving cars, this event is recommended for Scouts age 6 and up, with a parent of course. There are potties and a shaded lounge at Greeters. \r\n\r\nBring water, gum for dry throats, lip balm, snacks, a sun hat and some fun! Wear your BRS bandanas and patches! Scouts will be picked up and returned to Kidsville via art car.\r\n\r\nAbout Greeters:\r\n\r\nGreeters make the first impression when burners come home. Greeting is a vital role that helps shape and form the initial perceptions and expectations of first time participants. Greeting is the one and only chance to communicate with each and every participant on a one-on-one basis, mano-a-mano, facia-a-facia.\r\n\r\nArmed with wit, wisdom and infectious exuberance, Greeters take advantage of this opportunity by becoming skilled information providers conducting helpful, informational workshops to carloads of people.",

It creates a sense of a real city with street lamps and invokes an old tradition of lamplighting that contrasts nicely with the technical innovations of today. Check out this awesome blogpost to learn more about the history of lamplighting at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nHttp://blog.burningman.com/2010/06metropol/lamplighting-ritualizing-\tfunctional-necessity. \r\n\r\nThe Lamplighters draw more than 100 participants every evening of the event. In 1993 there were a dozen lanterns; now there are nearly 1000 to lift onto the spires that line the Esplanade pathways to the Man. To accomplish this considerable task, they ask for your help, and this year, they are inviting Black Rock Scouts and their parents to be a part of this community, this event, and their tradition. By the time the event ends, more than 1000 people will have helped the Lamplighters accomplish their important work.",

Friday will be a dedicated visit to Pier 2.0 and at the end of the pier, there will be a Spanish Galleon shipwreck we can all explore. Transportation will be in large fanciful ships, boats, and vessels. The Pier crew will meet us in pirate garb and speak and provide us our own personal tour. We will be climbing through the Spanish galleon wreck and search for clues to the occupants. Michelle, a member of the Pier\u2019s building crew (and an burner parent) will be hosting the event and explaining the artifacts.\r\n\r\nAbout Pier 2.0\r\n\r\n\r\nPier 2 is a magnification of Pier 1 in 2011. This is the second chapter in the life of a beloved piece of art. The stage for serendipity is now a launching pad for a grand tale as told through the remnants of a dead ship. Their intention is to create a story out of our art. They are replacing the words with experience and the chapters with exploration. Pier 2 will consist of 2 components: The Pier and The Ship.

A layed back place to get your social butterfly going and get out of the heat. I will be pulling people on skies behind my art boat before this is all over. Come over and visit us and let's relax and congregate together.\r\n\r\nI do need some help from you all on here. No money needed but I will ask this, since I do not have it in the budget for mass booze (some booze just not a mass) and beer, I must ask that you bring your cup and whatever you have laying around your camp that will get you off and that you are willing to share with you friend here at the Burners Against Scalpers Party. If you have extra, and want to donate to this on playa event, just bring it to the meet and greet and we can mix it into something. Also if anyone wants to help plan this and kick it off, I welcome ideas and more ideas. I am not the best planner of events so please give your ideas and maybe your help setting up or planning or what ever...see you all there.",

Realization and alignment with our source activates and empowers our channels of cosmic creativity. Pyramids, ancient stone circles, and temples were all built by armies of creators in alignment with heaven and earth. Uniting with the nature-field expands the identity of the individual beyond the bounds of body and ego, realizing the cosmic Self in Oneness with Collective Consciousness. The unitive mystical experience is the basis of all religions.

Here we empower people with new attitude to be birthed down our runway, with the encouragement of our MCs and DJs, onto the Esplanade and into their new lives.\r\n\r\nThe rules are simple. \r\n \r\n1. The stuff is free.  No returns or barter required although we do encourage recycling old costumes through us. \r\n\r\n2. You must wear what you want to take with you.  We are not giving \"product\" but \"experience\" and transformation is what is being offered-- not a consumerist feeding frenzy. (Decommodification)\r\n \r\n3.  If you have found something truly wonderful that makes your heart go pitter-patter... Consider giving it to the person next to you.  Generosity trumps the accumulation of stuff. (Gifting)\r\n\r\n4.  If you are looking for something specific, coming in with an agenda, you will not find it.  We aint got it. (and we might actually hide it from you! ;) Come in with an open mind to mix and match and be silly (Immediacy).\r\n\r\n4.  Donated costumes can be moopy.  Please help us keep the playa perfect and consciously dispose of all tags, loose threads and packaging. (Leave No Trace)\r\n\r\n5. Go forth onto the playa ready to participate and express yourself more fully.  Costume is the mix of fashion and theater and the playa is one big-ass stage.  After our runway, be prepared to make new connections in your new costumed persona or upgraded burner attitude.  (Participation and Radical Self Expression)",

The critical mass is thousands of women who proudly ride in this procession to create a wave of joy for themselves, each other, and the respectful bystanders who cheer them on their way.Please consider the privacy of the riders in this huge parade when tempted to take photos or videos without the women's permission.\r\nCelebrate your creativity with artful decorations,glitter,paint,be yourself to the max! Fertility is the perfect theme to participate in this joyful event, or come out to the parade route and cheer the Goddesses on! \r\nAn unforgettable, life-changing ritual is planned at the end of the ride, don't miss it. \r\n\r\nHistory of Critical Tits:\r\nThe ride started in 1996 on a day when the Critical Mass ride was taking place in San Francisco. Five of us painted our chests, got on our bikes and rode through BRC shouting \u201cCritical Tits.\u201d Women joined us and men bowed down. Each year since then the ride has more or less doubled in size. We had 5000+ riders in previous years.\r\n\r\nObviously something about the experience resonates with women. We are the largest gathering of women on the playa, and for many of us, the experience offers a meaningful connection to the power of female energy within ourselves and within our playa community.\r\n\r\nQ: When is the ride?\r\n\r\nA: The ride starts at 4 pm on Friday at the Man. Please respect the fact that the ride is for women and girls only.\r\n\r\nQ: What happens at the end of the ride?\r\n\r\nA: Each year, the ride ends in a different manner. The end-of-ride event is meant as an opportunity for women to connect with and celebrate each other.",

        "description": "Self expression is cool: flailing, head banging and stochastic gyration is all good fun. But communication is hard if our self expression is not understood. This class aims to cut to the chase and help you build your own vocabulary that reflects you, while imposing as little orthodox structure on your creativity as possible. Where most dance lessons focus on the vocabulary of dance, in this class you will have the opportunity to explore the phonemes of dance. These are the small bits that can be assembled into dance moves, just like we assemble phonemes into words that can be understood by others. Understanding these concepts renders the need to distinguish between one style/vocabulary and another far less important and makes the fusion of many styles and techniques much, much easier. It's like being able to read the phonetic alphabet, or seeing the green lines of binary code behind the Matrix. \r\n\r\nSo here's how it works: We're going to start off with a half an hour or so of these kinetic phonemes (little bits) and we're going to splice in some practice dances to solidify the concepts. Then your teachers are going to to DJ a set using some of the music you've practiced with and employing a playlist designed to illustrate how the social dances can be adapted to a wide variety of cool stuff. So cool in fact, that you will probably want to write down and download when you get home. (or you will experience a rush of feel-good chemicals because you're already familiar with such cool music and that will make you feel cool even though your self-perception is an illusion of your temporal brain chemistry.) During this dance, you may ask your teachers and any other veteran social dancers who may be attending for advice and technique. There won't be any dance etiquette at play here and the next scheduled dance that follows may well be in the nude, so relax, get over yourself and let's have fun.",

This unique form of movement therapy heals and frees physical, mental, emotional and spiritual blockages, blurring the lines between club culture, dance, music and internal exploration by tuning in to sound, movement, and the trance-like journey of self-discovery and self-realization! This mystical, inspirational and fun process modernizes ancient shamanic journeying techniques of drumming and the ritualistic use of the blindfold. With the Shamanic safe space set and a personal intention declared, you blindfold yourself to enter an individual experience of self-expression and inner awakening. The music brings you into yourself and encourages you to explore the unknown, the darkness where we transcend into deeper states of consciousness - where there is freedom to scream, cry, meditate, dance and everything in between -  with the available assistance of the leader and the gatekeepers. Throughout the dance, the leader may apply energetic healing by intuitively approaching dancers, but without the use of touch. Eventually the music brings us back home here on earth, and dancers relax upon the ground to receive hands on healing. Side by side, though in our own inner world, through this journey we each are given the chance to experiencing our sacred \"Vision Quest\". We dance our intention and seek to better understand our Soul's purpose. \r\n\r\nFirst-time gatekeepers encouraged to volunteer to help keep dancers safe during the dance - this is generally done energetically, though light touch may be used if necessary. All our welcome on this journey, however, you must be on time. This is  a respectful, safe and sacred event.",

Be sure to stay to The End for \r\none of the most perfect synchronizations in the entire movie!\r\n\r\nsynchronize: To cause (soundtrack and action) to match exactly in a film.\r\nsynchronicity: Coincidence of events that seem to be meaningfully related, \r\nconceived in Jungian theory as an explanatory principle on the same order as causality.\r\n\r\nThis mashup is a sublime example of synchronization and synchroncity.  \r\n\r\nSynchronicity bewteen albums and movies is relatively easy to find. Often times the mood of a musical\r\npiece can be flexible enough to fit with many scenes in a movie.  But in this case, the mood of \r\nthe various Pink Floyd albums across the course of the scenes in The Wizard of Oz seem to synchronize \r\nwith the mood of the movie perfectly.\r\n\r\nSynchronization is more difficult to find between an album and a movie. Of course you can adjust the start\r\npoint of a movie to create artificial synchronizations but you would not necessarily expect many other\r\ncomponents to align.   However, in this mashup you find absolutely amazing synchronized scenes.  At the risk\r\nof spoiling some surprises ... be sure to pay attention to the music and in particular the timing of the silences \r\nafter Dorothy's house lands in Oz.

No duds & no repeats like last year!!  Although I won't be sober, I have it arranged that a semi-sentient being will start the music on time!  Our trusty old favorite, tasty Ritz Crackers will be served.\r\nYou're on your own for cocktails although we usually bend the knee and pour a few for old friends as we spy them.  Also on the scene- our World Map that you can sign to make your attendance mark for all to see. Also our Playa famous gift tree, chock-a-block full of useful survival items.",

What role does spirituality play in terms of appreciating water and human behaviour towards water and environmental stewardship? We will explore and discuss these questions and more together. There will be examples presented from different places around the world (Singapore, San Antonio, TX, Bangladesh, etc...).

We are designed to be living conduits of fundamental creative energy streaming forth and manifesting into form.  The question is, how much are we impeding or allowing these vital currents to move and dance their way through us in each moment?  When we dissolve the inevitable veneers accumulated from our societal conditioning, we find at the core an inherently ecstatic nature.  Often touched upon inconsistently in fleeting moments of unification, it beckons us forth as a song calling us home.  Discover how to get out of your own way, dissolving resistance and accessing this essential core in order to ecstatically birth the fullness of each moment from a state of pure presence.",

We will examine how entheogen use can cast a light on some of the most ancient and perplexing questions of the role of the Ego in our lives; and how the Ego creates our Society and technology, and how our modern view of the role of the Ego - in both our lives and our Society - will shape the future we will all live.",

The result is often a heightened erotic state some people call a \u201cfull body orgasm,\u201d which can go on for many minutes and can lead to all kinds of ecstasies, insights, and even spiritual experiences.  \r\n\r\nHere are a few guiding principles if you\u2019re thinking of coming to the workshop (more at http://playajoy.org/?p=2758#more-2758):\r\n\r\n- Yes, participants get naked and give/receive erotic, genital massage.  So, this is only open to adults, and only participants \u2013 no spectators.\r\n\r\n- Givers of massage may be of any sex, receivers must have a penis. (One of the most powerful parts of this workshop is how gay, straight, & everyone else share erotic space together.)\r\n\r\n- You can come with a partner or try your luck at the workshop. Usually, about a dozen people come partnerless to each workshop.\r\n\r\n- There is no contact between participants other than the massage. This isn\u2019t group sex (not that there's anything wrong with that!) Boundaries are maintained and respected. We even ask that givers not look around the room \u2014 receivers can feel it when you\u2019re not tuned in.\r\n\r\n- Bring water, a towel and WetOnes for optimal pleasure. Pee ahead of time. Some people like to be blindfolded \u2013 bring a bandana or blindfold if you like.  Bring breath mints to gift to others!\r\n\r\n- Last year we had a line around the block a full hour before the workshop started. So, come early!\r\n\r\n- Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have time to do two full workshops, so you\u2019ll either give or receive, but not both. Both are hot!\r\n\r\nSee you on the playa!",

        "description": "Due to the extra traffic of our bourgeoning population pouring into the playa, the dust is expected to be much worse this year, so much so that they\u2019re calling it Futility 2.0. Even the Black Rock Rangers have faltered as their ranks have questioned their resolve in the face of such a menace. They need not fear, for The French Maid Brigade will once again provide their services gratis to the community of Black Rock City. Once again our citizens can rest assured that they will be protected from any and all dusty intrusions. \r\n\r\nEach year one or two rookie French Maids spend extra time addressing the situation with the Rangers only to realize, \u201cWait, they actually dress to look like dust!\u201d Indeed, if you could magnify a dust particle five billion times, you would see the likeness of a Black Rock Ranger. Clearly the Rangers have succumbed to the mentality of \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em.\" The French Maids have no such intentions with dust, will never surrender, and continue to support the radical self-expression of all who dwell on the playa through maintaining a dust-free environment for all who participate.\r\n\r\nMany enquiries are made every year as to how one might join such a venerable organization. You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa. Stop by our camp anytime for official recruitment or rendezvous with us on the playa. Please bring: non-feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, any other useful cleaning equipment, and your worst possible French accent. On Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O\u2019Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Caf\u00e9, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!",

While it\u2019s an art form dating backing to the birth of humanity, it\u2019s still relatively new in the United States. The glow of a molten, honey-like material at night is hypnotic. The radiant heat of the equipment illuminating the hot shop floor is an installation in itself. Glass is a dance, with each team developing its own choreography. We intend to include the audience with \u2018You Name It, We Make It\u2019 activities. People can submit a design and our collection of talented artists will assemble what was not thought possible. Our team consists of some of the most skilled emerging and established artists in Seattle, the mecca for glass working in the world. Each night the team will take at least 2 complex designs from the audience and take the 2-D drawing and pull the 3-D design from the hot glass. There is no limit to what can be achieved in glass, and that\u2019s what we intend to show. Glass blowing began in the Fertile Crescent and we hope to take it to Fertility 2.0. These professional artists are encyclopedias of information to anything relating to glass and high temperatures. With the making of glass, questions always arise, and we are equipped with the information to help people understand. All of our equipment was handmade by Evan Schuass, and was used last year in the Keyhole. Mobile glass studios are an excellent display of design, function, and efficiently. He has been commissioned from people all over the West Coast, and Hawaii to build these mobile shops. All the people included in Glass Camp are either producing artists or assistants to the highest level of glass workers in the world. We would like to share our gift and knowledge with the people of Burning Man. Everyone in this camp is here because they have a passion for glass art.",

You must apply for and be permitted as a Temporary Food Establishment by the NSHD if:\r\n\r\n* You will be cooking or serving food to large groups of more than 125* FELLOW CAMPERS of your theme camp on a consistent basis.\r\n\r\n(If you have a communal kitchen shared by 125 or more campers, but meals are prepared individually, or in smaller quantities than for 125 persons, a permit is not required, however we highly recommend you research and review safe food handling practices, starting with the Nevada Division of Health information).\r\n\r\n* You wish to share, cook or serve food or non-alcoholic beverages to the general Burning Man population (gifting food).\r\n\r\nHere are the permit procedures and deadlines:\r\n\r\nIf you have already applied for a permit, you should be receiving instructions in the mail soon.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning to make and give away food or drinks to the public on the playa including fresh squeezed juice, coffee with dairy, or even snow cones, you need a permit. Here's the scoop from Cindy Ulch, Supervisor with the Nevada State Health Divisions Public Health and Clinical Services Environmental Health Program:\r\n\r\nThe only application any camp needs is the \"Food Permit Application for Burning Man\" found here:\r\nhttp://health.nv.gov/BFHS_EHS.htm \r\n\r\nDon't wait until the last minute. It would be a shame to have to cancel your plans, or even risk being closed at the event.  That mailing address is  NSHD - PHCS 475 West Haskell Street Suite 38, Winnemucca, NV 89445.\r\n\r\nIn person:  No later than THURSDAY AUGUST 23rd - 4150 Technology Way Suite 100, Carson City, NV.

Mamawitz will be providing delicious cookies, milk, (maybe even a bagel!) and lots of love and caring for Burners requiring a little TLC - in English, Hebrew, French, and/or Spanish. The 2009 version of this event won the Acculturation Video award from Burning Man (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtX8Z-izffs\\). As Mamawitz says, \"everyone needs motherly advice, but who wants to hear it from their own mother?...oy, too much baggage!\" Come visit with Burning Man's very own Jewish Mother who dispenses love, nurturing, advice and no guilt (unless absolutely necessary).",

Usually, the highest chief of the visiting party is served first, followed by the highest chief of the host party, and then service proceeds based on the rank of the rest of the participants. The drink is served in a polished coconut half. The overall ceremony is highly ritualized, with specific gestures and phrases to be used at various times.\r\n\r\nOur Kava ceremony will be a first come first serve event if the turnout is too overwhelming!

Start your evenings with the most intense laughter you can experience. We laugh for no reason, other than for exercise, and health. Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through laughter. It\u2019s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits. Find much more info online by searching on Laughter Yoga, but come! Enjoy!",

        "description": "I became interested in how the shamans utilized sound, chant and music to guide and affect trance states as well as healing. I practiced as a healer at our center (www.bluemorphotours.com), specializing in using ayahuasca and sound to heal depression and generate transcendent experience of consciousness. http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0603/features/peru.html 4 years ago I started to branch out from ayahuasca and sought to bring the unique qualities of ayahuasca shamanism to music. I wanted to use the music to guide trance states induced by the music. The theory was to guide people to heart, love and direct spiritual or transcendent experience without being told where or how to go. The music itself would guide through the mix of sounds. I started a music partnership with my wife Wendy, who is a 15 year opera, choir and rock singer to create the music. The mix of her traditional musical training with my traditional shamanic training allowed for the right combination to make the music possible.We blended the musical structure found in the shamanism to existing electronic genres like World Music and House. The music itself is electronic with vocals sung by Wendy and me.As for the burn, we have three distinct types of music we could perform. The first would be the chants and icaros of traditional amazonian shamanism (leading ceremonies for groups of people), the second would be to perform our world music and the third, our house music. In addition, lectures on ayahuasca shamanism and the traditional uses of ayahuasca, how it is practiced, apprenticeship, working with elders and the modern uses of ayahuasca for healing.  In addition I created a project called Modern Shamanism designed to create a unique form of shamanic/spiritual exploration for Modern people based out of modern life experience. I could lead trances/meditations through this practice. www.modernshamanism.org",

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We\u2019ll have sticks available for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers. Today, there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal. Also, LSA is spreading around the US and world. Many more details are available at: www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html and www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 Master Dao passed away late 2010 at age 89, and one of our campers was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.",

Six host camps will have bartenders standing by with icy libations prepared exclusively for the ride participants.  We\u2019ll be stopping off at Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Celestial Bodies, Camp Swede, and the Tiki Bar.  How many naked cyclists can we squeeze into a tiki bar?  Come help us break last year\u2019s record.  We\u2019ll also be hitting Duckpond for keg beer and some slip-\u2019n-slide action.  As always, the famous naked bartenders of Comfort & Joy will be hosting the after party.  This ride isn\u2019t just an event, it\u2019s a tradition.  So if you\u2019re willing to meet the dress code, join us for one of the silliest parties on the playa.  Trust us, after the first couple of cocktails you won\u2019t mind being naked. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in helping to steward the ride, contact us at dunneasley@hotmail.com.  We can always use more rider wranglers.",

We then dispense our \"Tiki Punch\" (yes, it has a punch) well into the night. Party Naked Tiki Bar is the clothing optional bar that rewards your getting naked. This year we have 1800+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that \"do it\". Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We will also have activities scheduled for fun at the bar, check out our schedule when you come by. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day. Be LNT friendly and bring your own cup please.",

After over 40 years of dormancy, a new revolution has emerged, taken shape, revealed its face and resonated a strong voice to guide the global community.\r\n\r\nMitch Schultz and Charles Shaw share their new feature length documentary that focuses the lens at the nexus of this next-generation mystical revival.  The growing worldwide community of like minds continues to grow and intentionally gather to celebrate life and create positive change on the planet.  The project takes the pulse of the culture at transformational festivals around the world in 2012, including Symbiosis, Lightning in a Bottle, Desert Rocks, Sonic Bloom, Boom, Burning Man, Australia\u2019s Eclipse 2012 and Belize Solstice 2012, and many more.  With the backdrop of these amazing festivals and communicated through the individual festival participants, we explore a variety of different themes, including activism, art, consciousness, environmentalism, music, mythology, technology, and 2012 as a general framework to better understand and define the culture. \r\nCome join us, give us your opinion and help make a difference in the Universe.",

We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is \"Open\" and ready to accept your cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We don't accept any other recyclables, you must pack them out. And we definitely don't want your trash. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. Then you can ride the bike that powers the can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and BRC..!",

Through this workshop, we identify the areas where there is no space and together, we learn to let go of the restrictions that are preventing us from opening our hips, our heart and our mind.  \r\n\r\nIn this 2.5 hour workshop, students are facilitated to the discovery of their very own myofascial restrictions, and guided on how to release them. This is where the magic happens. This is the shift begins.\r\n\r\nAshley and Bryon work on an individual level to isolate the physical and emotional blockages that restrict us from achieving our full potential in each yoga posture. This revolutionizing approach to understanding the body will propel you years ahead in your yoga practice. Forget the eons of prep classes; you can meet your goals overnight. Revolutionized Yoga is the optimal solution for yoga practitioners that are craving a real, a rapid, a wild and a drastic shift in their yoga practice and their life.\r\n\r\nTaught by Ashley Holly, MA, RYT and Bryon Brewster, CST, BCSI, MT, CHN, Osteopath, this workshop explores and shares the linkages between the connective tissue, fascia, movement and the asana.",

Author Richard Leviton describes etheric \u201cblue dishes\u201d under all sacred sites that collect subtle cosmic energies and distribute them into the earth and atmosphere. For Burning Man 2007 I designed a sky blue dish 61 feet in diameter and 9 1/2 feet high with sky blue carpet to physically manifest this idea while providing an environment of floating in the sky. In the center are three geometric forms that embody Leviton\u2019s concept of an aspect of the Earth\u2019s energy body evolving from its current geometric form to an icosidodecahedron. I built a half dodecahedron that houses the Quasar Wave Transducer sound sculpture that produces low frequency vibrations in the range of brain waves and earth resonance, and a half icosidodecahedron steel frame covered in stainless steel mirror triangles. These two shapes are shaded by a half icosahedron steel frame covered in aluminet shade cloth so that one may experience these shapes both day and night. A 30 foot section facing east was opened during sunrise. The Sapphire Portal acted as a personal, planetary and galactic vibrational alignemnent environment, providing profound experiences for many participants.",

He is based in San Diego, California and teaches both 5 Rhythms and SheddingSkins workshops throughout the US and in Europe. \r\n\r\nThe SheddingSkins path is a seamless blend of Movement Meditation, Sound Alchemy, Shamanic Ritual and Tantric Ceremony into one cohesive practice where each of these medicines are used to create a comprehensive system of personal transformation. \r\n\r\nwww.sheddingskins.com \r\n\r\nTessabella is a Massage Therapist and spiritual dance practitioner who has found great passion, grounding and healing in movement.

During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in 2009 and 2010, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2012!",

Follow the white rabbit on a journey through the mandalic world of cosmic coincidence, open the door to lady serendipity and invite her in for a pot of freshly brewed synchronici-tea.\r\n\r\nTake a stroll into the infinite corridor of chaos and discover the self recursive nature of reality from humans to dark matter. This workshop will unravel the fractal geometry of our universe and allow you to witness the organic structures that grow straight out of the abyss - in the words of Douglas Hofstadter:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt turns out that an eerie type of chaos can lurk just behind a facade of order - and yet, deep inside the chaos lurks an even eerier type of order.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust a coincidence? Our lives tend to orchestrate a storyline filled with bizarre synchronicities and connections seemingly beyond explanation, however most are unaware of the extent that our cosmos reflects this characteristic. Ever wondered why the moon and the sun appear to be the same size from Earth? From the atom to the solar system, in this workshop we take a look into the truly unbelievable level of serendipity inherent in our universe.",

We need three eligable bachelors (or even more because there's enough of Ninzy to handle Gunga Din's personal hoardes) and come Friday evening before The Wall Street Burn out on the deep playa we will be hosting our show.  Complete with playa-sanctioned pyrotechnics, our 45 minute show will be an eye-popping experience indeed.  Head out beyond the Temple and look for the 21st Century version of The Dating Game set, pull up a chair, and get your curry on.  The winning bachelor and Ninzy will be whisked away in our very own Barbie's Mobile Whorehouse in plush comfort, complete with champagne and minions to act like sycophants to their very beck and call, and escorted to The Wall Street Burn.  Afterwards the lovely couple will come back to Barbie Death Camp to perhaps consumate their date.  Or not.

Bear Margaritas for all!!\r\n\r\nThe Salon is a night of creative expression. Our community started hosting salons in January 2010 as a safe space for the folks of Synchronicity and our friends to share finished or unfinished works of art, poetry, song, or any form of creative release.  The idea was to encourage people in the community to create, share, and hear thoughts or ideas from fellow creative souls.  It has since expanded, and we have enjoyed works of musicians, poets, storytellers, palindromists, historians, novelists, ramblers, gamblers, painters, filmmakers, drunks, fathers, mothers, lovers, dreamers, and psychedelic clowns from all over this land!\r\nA crowd of lovely folks from across the playa will be gathering at 7.30 pm in preparation for the night's event.

With us you will take it to the next level as a form of sensation play or even a bit of dominance and submission with your partner. Where you take it is up to you. The class is taught by men and women who have been involved in the tickling community for several years.\r\n\r\nIt is best to bring a partner to play with and something comfortable to lay upon. We will provide some basic tickling instruments and a bit of rope if you want to bind your partners wrists during the exercise (optional). If you don't have a partner you may still attend and listen or we might match you up. Due to possible space limitations we may give preference to those with a partner first.\r\n\r\nVolunteers are also welcome for our demos. This is an audience participation so be prepared to laugh, giggle, snort, chortle, etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough tickling is not always in an adult setting due to the nature of the talk and our interaction we ask that all participants and observers be at least 18 years of age. All genders and orientations are welcome to attend and volunteer.\r\n\r\nYou will learn some new techniques to enhance sensual play with other people and we will teach you some ticklish locations you may not have been aware of.\r\n\r\nIf the class is interested we can go into more of a deeper talk about the power exchange aspect of tickling.\r\n\r\nCome visit us and have fun. We'll likely either be in the large dome or under shelter at Otis Spankmore. We will post sign(s) to help direct you to the class.",

Join RhythmWave's Spinnaker (aka Cynthia Kennedy from Olympia Washington) to this 2 hour class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.",

Whythenose.com is dedicated to the act of wearing a clown nose everyday, in order to make people smile.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s here for YOU\u2026to encourage you with an act of Heroic Uninhibited Innocence.\r\nIt\u2019s really that simple. In a world filled with distractions and distrust, you\u2019d be amazed at how many people have lost a sense of childlike wonder. Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t\u2026\r\n\r\nIn the year since WhyTheNose was launched on the Playa at Rites of Passage, the project has transformed not only me, but it's brought together thousands of people through the photos and videos I've created.\r\n\r\nWearing a clown nose is fun, it\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s free if you already have the nose. YOU CAN COME GRAB ONE AT CENTER CAMP CAFE AND OTHER LOCATIONS ALL WEEK AT BRC...I'm bringing 5000 :)\r\n\r\nWhyTheNose is only here to show you how joyful it is to change someone\u2019s day with a simple, silly act.\r\nTrust me, the nose breaks through barriers and opens doors every time you wear it\u2026give it a try!\r\n\r\nWhen you wear it and you\u2019re waiting with a kind word, a laugh, a validation that you\u2019re NOT crazy, just happy?\r\nMAN, that\u2019s powerful powerful stuff!\r\n\r\nUltimately, one\u2019s attitude, your inner light, your reason raison d\u2019etre that can make a difference in people\u2019s lives and it\u2019s a simple as the nose on your face.\r\n\r\nBe loving and see what happens!\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of the nose is what creates the dissonance and that slight shift in \u201creality\u201d is very important..it can (gently) jar people enough to open that door, that opportunity in them for opening up and taking a chance, taking a little risk to interact with someone they don\u2019t know..who has on a clown nose!?!\r\n\r\nFind WhyTheNose at Center Camp Cafe all week and if you pick up a Nose, would you please wear it Wednesday? I want YOU to help me spread the joy and beauty and ethos of OUR community with this one act you take take home and use every day :)\r\n\r\nThank's for the love, sfTex",

The first ~WaVe~ Ver. 1 prototype debuted in NYC in Feb 2011 at the Funhaus technology fair with subsequent indoor, outdoor and mobile versions appearing at various art and bass culture events during the spring and summer throughout in the NYC area including the LOST HORIZONS NIGHT MARKET and the FIGMENT NYC 2011 and 2012 art festival on Governor's Island. \r\nIf you have had the TSUNAMI BASS EXPERIENCE, then you know how it LOOKS, SOUNDS, and FEELS... \r\n\r\nThe ~WaVe~ installation is capable of transducing the low end frequencies as low as 5 Hz, provides a sensory enhancement oft described as a \"bassface inducing,\" but more importantly, taps directly into one's kinestetic learning/thinking modality. It is this, when combined with the proper audio and visual ~WaVeS~ for expontential enahancement, that sparks the intuitive, thereby facilitating proper BASS CULTURE APPRECIATION. \r\n\r\nSo come on by and take a dip in the deluge, challenge your perceptions on the Tsunami Bass Experience's ~WaVe~2.0, custom built 'Body~Sonic' dance platforms that will rumble ur rectum and sooth your heart/mind with oh so fine low end frequency via proper BASS!!",
